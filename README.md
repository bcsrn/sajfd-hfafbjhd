IR Course SEO competition
For this part, your goal is to put on your "search engine optimization" hat. Your job is to create a webpage that scores highest for the query: sajfd hfafbjhd --- two terms, lower case, no quote. As of today (Jan 24, 2019), there are no hits for this query on either Google or Bing. Based on our discussions of search engine ranking algorithms, you know that several factors may impact a page's rank. Your goal is to use this knowledge to promote your own page to the top of the list.
What we're doing here is a form of SEO contest. While you have great latitude in how you approach this problem, you are not allowed to engage in any unethical or illegal behavior. Please read the discussion of "white hat" versus "black hat" SEO over at Wikipedia.
Rules of the game:
Somewhere in the page (possibly in the non-viewable source html) you must include your name or some other way for us to identify you.
Your target page may only be a TAMU student page, a page on your own webserver, a page on a standard blog platform (e.g., wordpress), or some other primarily user-controlled page
Your target page CAN NOT be a twitter account, a facebook page, a Yahoo Answers or similar page
No wikipedia vandalism
No yahoo/wiki answers questions
No comment spamming of blogs
If you have concerns/questions/clarifications, please post on Piazza and we will discuss
For your homework turnin for this part, you should provide us the URL of your target page and a brief discussion (2-4 paragraphs) of the strategies you are using. We will issue the query and check the rankings at some undetermined time in the next couple of weeks. You might guess that major search engines take some time to discover and integrate new pages: if I were you, I'd get a target page up immediately.
